# Guided Restore Feature Implementation

## Problem Solved
**User Question**: "I don't know which should I restore first, the database backup or the file backup?"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Guided Restore System**
- **Smart Backup Pairing**: Automatically detects compatible database and file backups created within 5 minutes of each other
- **Recommended Order**: Database first, then files (with explanation why)
- **Alternative Option**: Files first (for special cases)
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Handles both restores in sequence with proper error handling

### 2. **Why Database First is Recommended**
- **Metadata Integrity**: Database contains references to files and documents
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures file references match actual files
- **System Stability**: Prevents orphaned file references
- **Best Practice**: Standard approach used by system administrators

### 3. **Key Features Added**

#### **BackupManager Class Enhancements:**
- `guidedRestore()` - Performs sequential restore with proper order
- `getCompatibleBackupPairs()` - Finds matching database and file backups
- Smart error handling and rollback capabilities
- Detailed logging and progress reporting

#### **User Interface Improvements:**
- **Guided Restore Section**: Prominent recommendation for users
- **Backup Pair Selection**: Dropdown showing compatible backups with sizes
- **Order Selection**: Clear explanation of why database-first is recommended
- **Educational Content**: Explains the reasoning behind the recommendation

### 4. **Technical Implementation**

#### **Backup Compatibility Detection:**
```php
// Matches backups created within 5 minutes of each other
$time_diff = abs($db_time - $file_time) <= 300; // 5 minutes tolerance
```

#### **Restore Process Flow:**
1. **Validation**: Check both backup files exist
2. **Order Selection**: Database first (recommended) or files first
3. **Sequential Restore**: Execute in chosen order with error handling
4. **Verification**: Confirm successful completion
5. **Rollback**: Automatic recovery if any step fails

### 5. **User Experience Benefits**
- **No More Confusion**: Clear guidance on restore order
- **One-Click Solution**: Single action restores both components
- **Safety Features**: Automatic backup of current data before restore
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout process
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback on failure

### 6. **Error Handling & Safety**
- Validates backup file existence before starting
- Creates safety backup of current data
- Provides detailed error messages
- Automatic rollback on partial failures
- Maintains system consistency

## Result
Users now have a clear, guided process for restoring backups with:
- ✅ Automatic detection of compatible backup pairs
- ✅ Clear recommendation: Database first for data integrity
- ✅ One-click guided restore process
- ✅ Educational content explaining the reasoning
- ✅ Safe error handling and recovery

The system eliminates user confusion and ensures proper restore procedures are followed.

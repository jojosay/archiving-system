# Backup and Restore Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Backup Structure Problem**
- **Issue**: Files were being backed up with incorrect path structure
- **Fix**: Modified `exportFiles()` method to preserve the complete directory structure including the `storage/` directory
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `addDirectoryToZipWithFullPath()` method
  - Updated backup to include full path from project root
  - Ensures backup contains `storage/` directory with all subdirectories

### 2. **Restore Path Problem**
- **Issue**: Files were being extracted to wrong location (`includes/../` instead of project root)
- **Fix**: Modified `restoreFiles()` method to extract to project root, preserving original directory structure
- **Changes**:
  - Extract ZIP to project root instead of storage directory
  - Automatically recreates `storage/` directory structure
  - Added safety backup of current files before restore

### 3. **Permission and Verification Issues**
- **Issue**: Restored files had incorrect permissions and no verification
- **Fix**: Added proper permission setting and file counting
- **Changes**:
  - Added `setDirectoryPermissions()` method for recursive permission setting
  - Added `countFilesRecursively()` method for verification
  - Improved error handling and rollback functionality

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Path Preservation**: Backup now preserves the complete `storage/` directory structure
2. **Correct Restore Location**: Files are restored to their original locations
3. **Safety Features**: Current files are backed up before restore
4. **Better Verification**: File count and structure verification after operations
5. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and automatic rollback on failure

## Testing Results

- ✅ Backup creates proper ZIP structure with `storage/` directory
- ✅ Restore extracts files to correct original locations
- ✅ Directory structure is preserved during backup and restore
- ✅ Files maintain proper permissions after restore
- ✅ Safety backup is created before restore operations

## Files Modified

- `includes/backup_manager.php`: Complete rewrite of backup and restore methods

The backup and restore functionality now works correctly, preserving the original directory structure and file locations as required.

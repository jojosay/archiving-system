# Create Your First GitHub Release - Step by Step

## Step 1: Update Version for Testing

First, let's increment the version to test the update system:

### Edit `config/config.php`:
```php
// Change from:
define('APP_VERSION', '1.0.0');

// To:
define('APP_VERSION', '1.0.1');
```

### Edit `config/version.php`:
```php
// Update build number:
define('APP_BUILD', '2025.01.14.002');
```

## Step 2: Update Repository Configuration

Make sure `config/version.php` has your correct GitHub details:
```php
define('GITHUB_REPO_OWNER', 'jojosay');
define('GITHUB_REPO_NAME', 'archiving-system');
```

## Step 3: Create Release Package

Run the preparation script:
```cmd
php scripts/prepare_release.php
```

This creates a clean ZIP file in the `releases/` folder.

## Step 4: Create GitHub Release

### Via GitHub Website:
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/jojosay/archiving-system
2. **Click "Releases"** (right sidebar or top tabs)

4. **Fill in details:**

**Tag version:** `v1.0.1`

1. **Don't commit the version changes yet**
2. **Go to App Updates page** in your application
3. **Click "Check for Updates"**
4. **Should detect v1.0.1 as available!**

### Expected Result:
```
Update Available!
Current Version: 1.0.0
Latest Version: 1.0.1
```

## Step 6: Verify Release

After creating the release:
1. âœ… Release appears on GitHub
2. âœ… ZIP file is downloadable
3. âœ… Update system detects new version
4. âœ… Release notes display properly

## Troubleshooting

### "No releases found"
- Make sure release is published (not draft)
- Check repository name in config
- Verify release has a tag starting with 'v'

### "Update not detected"
- Clear browser cache
- Check version format (v1.0.1)
- Verify GitHub repository is public

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure repository is public
- Check GitHub API rate limits

## Next Steps
